# Python Algorithms

I've used C#, C++, and also Java predominantly in school. After a summer at Chartboost,
I wanted to learn Python because most of our core services, API, and backend servers 
are built using Python and Flask. 

First, I used the Python documentation to familarize myself with Python

Then I went over all the tutorials in Learn Python the Hard Way for better
understanding of all the ins and outs of Python: 
http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/

I rewrote some of the algorithmic questions in Python and currently learning more!
