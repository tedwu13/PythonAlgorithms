Object Oriented Programming

Difference between class and object is that 
Class is written piece of code which is used to define the blueprint which consists of attributes 
which don't change during the execution of a program
Object is an instance of a class so it can be destroyed and has a limited timespan

Method- like open() or close() in a class. Instead of data/attributes, it is actually a function within a class

Virtual method, pure virtual method
Virual method/function is a function where its behavior can be overridden within an inheriting class 
by same signature

Virtual functions allow a program to call methods that don't necessarily even exist at the moment the code is compiled.


Constructor
A constructor resembles an instance method, but it differs from a method in that it has no explicit return type,
It is not implicitly implied and constructors often have the same name as the declaring class. 
They have the task of initializing the object's data members and of establishing the invariant of the class

Destructor
In object-oriented programming, a destructor  is a method which is automatically invoked when the object is destroyed.


Base class
Derived class
Inheritance
Encapsulation
Multiple inheritance (and give an example)
Delegation and forwarding
Composition and Aggregation

Abstract class
Interface 
method overriding
method overloading
Difference between method overriding and method overloading

Polymorphism (without resorting to examples)
is-a versus has-a relationships (with examples)
Method signatures (what's included in one)
Method visibility (e.g. public/private/other)
